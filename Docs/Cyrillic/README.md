# Cyrillic text

Example characters: `Ж` `Д` `Ш` `Я` `Ь`

The Cyrillic alphabet, along with other non-Latin alphabets are planned to be fully/partially supported, but I don't have too much time to do it myself, and not all characters will be possible [see: Advanced Characters](/Docs/Advanced-Characters/)
